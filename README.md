## 🏗️ Architecture

This app is built with the **Clean Architecture** and **MVI pattern**, ensuring that each layer is independent and can be tested individually.

### 📚 Layers

1. **Data Layer**: Handles interaction with Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Storage).
2. **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic and use cases.
3. **Presentation Layer**: Manages the UI with MVI, keeping the UI responsive and maintaining a clean state.

## 🧱 Code Structure

- **Base classes**: The app uses base fragments for consistent UI design and behavior across screens. For example, `BaseFragment` for general fragment logic, and `BaseBottomSheetFragment` for BottomSheet dialogs.

- **Fragments**: The app's core UI components are based on fragments, each corresponding to a specific feature.

- **ViewModels**: Every screen in the app is paired with a ViewModel, following the MVI pattern, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

- **Use Cases**: Each business operation (like creating a post, fetching chats, etc.) is encapsulated in a use case, ensuring the app remains scalable.
