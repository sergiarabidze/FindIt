# FindIt - Lost & Found App

FindIt is a modern, feature-packed Android app designed to help users find and report lost items using a clean, efficient, and intuitive interface. This app leverages Firebase Authentication, Firestore, Firebase Storage, and follows the Clean Architecture and MVI pattern to ensure scalability, maintainability, and smooth performance.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication.
- **Post Creation**: Users can create posts for lost and found items, including adding photos, descriptions, and locations.
- **Chat**: Secure messaging between users for item retrieval or reporting.
- **Location Services**: Mark locations on the map for found items or lost items.
- **Image Upload**: Upload photos for posts with Firebase Storage.
- **MVI Pattern**: The app follows the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architecture for clear separation of concerns and better state management.

## Architecture

This app is built with the **Clean Architecture** and **MVI pattern**, ensuring that each layer is independent and can be tested individually.

### Layers:
1. **Data Layer**: Handles interaction with Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Storage).
2. **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic and use cases.
3. **Presentation Layer**: Manages the UI with MVI, keeping the UI responsive and maintaining a clean state.

## Tech Stack

- **Firebase**:
    - Authentication
    - Firestore (Database)
    - Firebase Storage
- **Dagger Hilt**: Dependency injection framework for Android to simplify the management of dependencies.
- **Kotlin**: The main programming language used.
- **Coroutines**: For managing background tasks.
- **Jetpack Navigation**: Used for navigating between fragments and activities.
- **RecyclerView**: For displaying lists in a smooth, scrollable manner.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (latest version recommended)
- Firebase Project setup for Authentication, Firestore, and Firebase Storage.
- Basic knowledge of Kotlin and Android development.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/findit.git
    cd findit
    ```

2. **Add Firebase credentials**:
    - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a new project, and add your Android app.
    - Download the `google-services.json` and place it in the `app/` directory.

3. **Enable Firebase services**:
    - Authentication: Enable Email/Password authentication in Firebase Authentication.
    - Firestore: Enable Firestore in your Firebase project.
    - Firebase Storage: Enable Firebase Storage for image uploads.

4. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure to sync your project with Gradle to install all dependencies, including Dagger Hilt, Firebase SDKs, and others.

5. **Run the app**:
   You should now be able to run the app on an emulator or a real device.


## Code Structure

- **Base classes**: The app uses base fragments for consistent UI design and behavior across screens. For example, `BaseFragment` for general fragment logic, and `BaseBottomSheetFragment` for BottomSheet dialogs.

- **Fragments**: The app's core UI components are based on fragments, each corresponding to a specific feature (like `ChatListFragment`, `AddPostFragment`, etc.).

- **ViewModels**: Every screen in the app is paired with a ViewModel, following the MVI pattern, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

- **Use Cases**: Each business operation (like creating a post, fetching chats, etc.) is encapsulated in a use case, ensuring the app remains scalable.

### Issues and Feature Requests

If you find any bugs or want to request new features, please open an issue.

## Future Improvements

- **Push Notifications**: Add real-time notifications for new messages or posts to enhance user engagement.
- **Map Integration**: Enhance the map functionality with better location markers and geofencing for item locations.
